An applied introduction to statistical reasoning in the health and behavioral sciences, emphasizing interpretation, communication, transparency, and reproducibility. Topics include data management, cleaning, & quality control, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization & communication, probability, statistical inference, sampling variability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, non-parametric tests, simple linear regression, and multiple regression. Students will learn to translate scientific questions into statistical frameworks and evaluate study designs (observational, experimental, and randomized), with attention to bias, confounding, and effect modification. The course features active learning through asynchronous instruction, collaborative data challenges, and critical appraisal of real-world research. Analyses will be conducted using R and RStudio, with integration of tools like GitHub, RMarkdown, OSF, and REDCap for reproducible workflows.
